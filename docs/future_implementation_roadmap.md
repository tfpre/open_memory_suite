# Open Memory Suite: Future Implementation Roadmap
*Date: August 1, 2025*  
*Phase: Post-M1 Strategic Planning*

## Executive Summary

With M1 milestone achieved (100% recall, comprehensive test coverage, async-first architecture), we now focus on the **core value proposition**: intelligent cost-aware memory routing through the FrugalDispatcher. This roadmap prioritizes systematic progression from cost modeling → rule-based dispatcher → ML-enhanced dispatcher → benchmark ecosystem.

**Primary Goal**: Achieve M2 milestone showing ≥40% cost reduction with ≥90% recall retention using rule-based FrugalDispatcher.

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ M1 Achievements (Completed)
- **Adapter Architecture**: Base class + FAISS + InMemory adapters working
- **Trace System**: Real-time JSONL logging with context managers  
- **Test Infrastructure**: 43/43 tests passing, 91% coverage, 300s timeouts
- **Integration Validation**: Multi-adapter harness running end-to-end
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond InMemory retrieval, TF-IDF similarity working

### 🎯 Core Technical Debt Resolved
- Python 3.12 compatibility across all dependencies
- Pydantic v2 throughout (no v1 conflicts)
- Async-first design with proper cleanup
- Robust error handling and empty-index edge cases

### 📊 Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 91% with comprehensive adapter, harness, and trace tests
- **Performance**: 100/100 items stored in 0.01s, retrieval <0.001s
- **Reliability**: Zero flaky tests, deterministic execution

---

## Strategic Priorities & First Principles

### 1. **Frugality-First Design Philosophy**
Every component must demonstrably reduce total cost while maintaining recall. We measure success by **cost-effectiveness curves**, not feature completeness.

### 2. **Research Validation Over Production Features**  
Focus on benchmark credibility and academic rigor. The goal is to prove the concept scientifically before optimizing for deployment.

### 3. **Incremental Value Delivery**
Each milestone must provide standalone value. No "big bang" releases - each phase should improve the cost/recall trade-off measurably.

### 4. **Community-Driven Benchmark Standards**
Design for external contributions. Every metric, dataset, and evaluation must be reproducible by third parties.

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

## 🚀 **Phase 2A: Cost-Aware Foundation (Days 1-5)**  
*Goal: Enable cost-based decision making*

### P1 - Cost Modeling System
**Owner: Lead Developer**

```yaml
# Target: /open_memory_suite/benchmark/cost_model.yaml
operations:
  store:
    faiss_embedding: 0.0001    # $0.0001 per item (local compute)
    faiss_index_write: 0.0000  # Free (local FAISS)
    memory_write: 0.0000       # Free (in-memory)
    zep_graph_write: 0.05      # $0.05 per complex entity extraction
    
  retrieve:
    faiss_search: 0.0001       # $0.0001 per query
    memory_search: 0.0000      # Free TF-IDF computation  
    zep_graph_query: 0.02      # $0.02 per graph traversal
    
  summarization:
    gpt_35_turbo: 0.002        # $0.002 per summary call
    local_llama_7b: 0.0001     # Estimated compute cost
```

**Implementation:**
- `CostModel` class loading YAML configurations
- Cost estimation hooks in all adapters (already stubbed)
- Runtime cost tracking in trace logs
- Cost projection utilities for dispatcher decisions

**Success Criteria:**
- All adapters report realistic cost estimates
- Trace logs capture cumulative costs per session
- 10x cost differential between cheapest (InMemory) and most expensive (Zep) operations

---

### P2 - FileStoreAdapter Implementation  
**Owner: Lead Developer**

**Design Specifications:**
- **Storage**: JSON files in hierarchical directory structure
- **Retrieval**: Linear scan with keyword matching (slow but cheap)
- **Use Case**: Cheapest persistent option, acceptable for archival memory

```python
class FileStoreAdapter(MemoryAdapter):
    """Ultra-cheap file-based persistence with linear scan retrieval."""
    
    def __init__(self, storage_path: Path, max_files_per_dir: int = 1000):
        # Hierarchical storage: /base/YYYY/MM/DD/session_id/items.jsonl
        # Linear scan retrieval (slow but zero API cost)
        
    async def store(self, item: MemoryItem) -> bool:
        # Append to daily JSONL file
        # Cost: ~$0.00001 per item (file I/O)
        
    async def retrieve(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> RetrievalResult:
        # Scan recent files first (recency bias)
        # Simple keyword matching
        # Cost: scales with storage size
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 1000 items stored/retrieved successfully  
- 10-100x slower than FAISS, but near-zero cost
- Graceful handling of large file collections

---

## 🧠 **Phase 2B: Rule-Based Intelligence (Days 6-12)**
*Goal: Achieve M2 milestone with intelligent routing*

### P3 - FrugalDispatcher v0 (Rule-Based)
**Owner: Lead Developer** | **Support: Research Assistant**

**Architecture:**
```python
class FrugalDispatcher:
    """Cost-aware memory routing with pluggable decision policies."""
    
    def __init__(self, adapters: List[MemoryAdapter], cost_model: CostModel):
        self.adapters = adapters  # [InMemory, FAISS, FileStore, Zep]
        self.cost_model = cost_model
        self.policy = HeuristicPolicy()  # v0: rules-based
        
    async def route_memory(self, item: MemoryItem, context: ConversationContext) -> RoutingDecision:
        """Core intelligence: decide store/summarize/drop + which adapter."""
        
        # 1. Triage Decision (store/summarize/drop)
        action = self.policy.decide_action(item, context)
        
        # 2. Adapter Selection (if storing)
        if action.should_store:
            adapter = self.policy.choose_adapter(item, self.adapters, self.cost_model)
            
        return RoutingDecision(action=action, adapter=adapter, reasoning=...)
```

**Rule-Based Heuristics (v0):**
1. **Content Analysis Rules:**
   - Names/dates/numbers → Store (high value)
   - Questions from user → Always store (queryable)  
   - Assistant acknowledgments ("got it", "ok") → Drop (low value)
   - Long responses (>500 tokens) → Summarize (cost optimization)

2. **Adapter Selection Rules:**
   - Factual content → FAISS (semantic retrieval)
   - Recent conversation (last 10 turns) → InMemory (fast access)
   - Archival content → FileStore (cheap persistence)
   - Structured entities → Zep (when available)

3. **Cost-Aware Routing:**
   - If cost_budget_exceeded → prefer cheaper adapters
   - If recall_critical_query → use best adapter regardless of cost

**Success Criteria (M2 Target):**
- **40% cost reduction** vs. "store everything in FAISS" baseline
- **≥90% recall** on PersonaChat evaluation questions
- Clear routing decision logs with human-interpretable reasoning

        self,
        policies: List[MemoryPolicy],
        datasets: List[Dataset], 
        trials: int = 5
    ) -> BenchmarkResults:
        # A/B testing with statistical significance

## 🛠 **Technical Architecture Decisions**

### 1. **Cost Model Design**
**Decision**: YAML-based cost configuration with runtime updates
**Rationale**: Flexibility for different deployment scenarios without code changes
**Alternative Rejected**: Hard-coded costs (not adaptable)

### 2. **Dispatcher Policy Interface**  
**Decision**: Pluggable policy architecture (rules → ML → RL progression)
**Rationale**: Research experimentation without breaking existing functionality
**Alternative Rejected**: Monolithic dispatcher (hard to extend)

### 3. **Evaluation Framework**
**Decision**: LLM-as-judge with human validation sampling
**Rationale**: Scalable evaluation with quality control
**Alternative Rejected**: Pure human evaluation (doesn't scale)

### 4. **Memory Adapter Standardization**
**Decision**: Maintain unified interface with cost estimation hooks
**Rationale**: Fair comparison across fundamentally different storage systems
**Alternative Rejected**: Adapter-specific metrics (not comparable)
