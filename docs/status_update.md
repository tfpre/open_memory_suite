# Open Memory Suite - Status Update

**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Phase:** M1 Complete â†’ M2 Planning  
**Lead:** Research Team  

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed (M1 Milestone)

**Core Architecture**
- âœ… Async-first memory adapter system with abstract base class
- âœ… FAISS vector store adapter with SentenceTransformers embeddings
- âœ… Real-time JSONL trace logging system with context managers  
- âœ… Benchmark harness for end-to-end evaluation
- âœ… Pydantic v2 data models throughout (MemoryItem, RetrievalResult, TraceEvent)
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (28/28 tests passing, 93% coverage)
- âœ… Python 3.12 compatibility with PyTorch 2.4.0, FAISS 1.9.0

**Key Technical Features**
- Async context manager lifecycle for adapters (`async with adapter:`)
- Persistence support with automatic save/load on adapter lifecycle
- Vector similarity search with metadata filtering
- Performance tracing with latency/cost/success metrics
- Poetry dependency management with proper version constraints

**Validation Results**
- Integration test shows 100% recall rate on sample conversations
- 8 trace events logged (5 store, 3 retrieve operations) 
- FAISS adapter handles 5-turn conversation sessions effectively
- All core functionality working end-to-end

### ðŸ”„ Current Issues

**Minor Technical Debt**
- Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings (json_encoders, class-based config)
- datetime.utcnow() deprecation in Python 3.12
- BERT attention mask deprecation in transformers

**Architecture Gaps**
- Only one adapter implemented (FAISS) - dispatcher needs options
- No cost modeling system yet
- No actual frugal memory dispatcher logic
- Missing production adapters (Zep, Neo4j, etc.)

## M2 Milestone: "Cost-Aware Memory Routing"

### ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Goals

**Core Value Proposition**
Build a **frugal memory dispatcher** that intelligently routes memory operations across adapters based on cost, performance, and use case requirements.

**Key Differentiator**
Unlike existing solutions that use single memory stores, we provide cost-aware routing between multiple storage backends with different cost/performance profiles.

### ðŸ“‹ Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Adapter Ecosystem (High Priority)

**1. InMemoryAdapter** 
```python
# Ultra-fast, zero-cost, ephemeral storage
class InMemoryAdapter(MemoryAdapter):
    # Benefits: 0ms latency, no storage costs, perfect for sessions
    # Tradeoffs: Data lost on process restart
    # Use cases: Short conversations, testing, temporary storage
```

**2. FileStoreAdapter**
```python  
# Cheapest persistence, slower retrieval
class FileStoreAdapter(MemoryAdapter):
    # Benefits: Minimal cost, unlimited storage, simple debugging
    # Tradeoffs: Slow retrieval, no semantic search
    # Use cases: Archival memory, cost-sensitive applications
```

**3. Cost Modeling System**
```yaml
# config/cost_tables.yaml
adapters:
  InMemoryAdapter:
    store_cost: 0.0
    retrieve_cost: 0.0  
    storage_cost_per_mb: 0.0
    latency_ms: [1, 5]  # min, max
    
  FAISStoreAdapter:
    store_cost: 0.001   # per embedding
    retrieve_cost: 0.002  # per query
    storage_cost_per_mb: 0.05
    latency_ms: [10, 50]
    
  FileStoreAdapter:
    store_cost: 0.0001
    retrieve_cost: 0.01   # expensive due to full scan
    storage_cost_per_mb: 0.001
    latency_ms: [100, 1000]
```

#### Phase 2: Frugal Dispatcher Core

**Rule-Based Dispatcher v0**
```python
class FrugalDispatcher:
    """Cost-aware memory routing with heuristics"""
    
    async def store(self, item: MemoryItem, policies: DispatchPolicy):
        # Route based on:
        # - Item importance (metadata flags)
        # - Session duration (temp vs persistent)  
        # - Cost budget constraints
        # - Adapter health/availability
        
    async def retrieve(self, query: str, policies: DispatchPolicy):
        # Multi-adapter retrieval with:
        # - Cost-based adapter selection
        # - Fallback chains (FAISS -> FileStore)
        # - Result merging and deduplication
```

**Policy Examples**
```python
@dataclass
class DispatchPolicy:
    max_cost_per_query: float = 0.01
    prefer_speed: bool = True
    require_persistence: bool = False
    fallback_adapters: List[str] = ["FileStoreAdapter"]
```

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Evaluation Framework

**Dataset Integration**
- PersonaChat conversations â†’ ConversationSession objects
- Multi-turn dialogue evaluation scenarios
- Cost efficiency benchmarks alongside recall@k

**Advanced Metrics**
```python
class CostEfficiencyMetrics:
    recall_at_k: float
    cost_per_query: float  
    latency_p95: float
    cost_efficiency_ratio: float  # recall/cost
    adapter_utilization: Dict[str, float]
```

**A/B Testing Framework**
```python
async def compare_policies(
    policy_a: DispatchPolicy,
    policy_b: DispatchPolicy,
    test_sessions: List[ConversationSession]
) -> PolicyComparisonResult:
    # Run same workload through different policies
    # Compare cost, performance, accuracy
```

## Future Research Directions (M3+)

### Advanced Optimization

**Memory Summarization**
- Compress old memories to reduce storage costs
- Hierarchical summarization (turn â†’ session â†’ topic)
- Configurable retention policies

**Learning Dispatcher**  
- ML-based routing using query patterns and success metrics
- Reinforcement learning for cost optimization
- Adaptive policies based on user behavior

**Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- Per-user cost tracking and budget enforcement
- Isolated memory spaces with shared infrastructure
- Enterprise-grade access controls

### Production Features

**LangChain Integration**
```python
from langchain.memory import OpenMemorySuiteMemory

memory = OpenMemorySuiteMemory(
    policy=DispatchPolicy(max_cost_per_query=0.005),
    adapters=["InMemoryAdapter", "FAISStoreAdapter"]
)
```

**REST API Server**
```http
POST /memory/store
POST /memory/retrieve  
GET /memory/stats
GET /memory/costs
```

**Monitoring & Analytics**
- Real-time cost tracking dashboard
- Performance analytics (latency, success rates)
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Alert system for budget overruns

### Research Questions

1. **Optimal Cost Models**: Token-based vs operation-based vs time-based pricing?
2. **Consistency Guarantees**: How to handle eventual consistency across adapters?
3. **Failure Recovery**: Graceful degradation strategies when adapters fail?
4. **Privacy Boundaries**: How to handle sensitive data across different storage tiers?
5. **Scalability Patterns**: Horizontal scaling of dispatcher logic?

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **InMemoryAdapter** (1-2 days) - Simplest implementation to validate interface
2. **Cost Modeling System** (2-3 days) - YAML configuration + cost calculation
3. **Basic FrugalDispatcher** (3-4 days) - Rule-based routing logic
4. **FileStoreAdapter** (2-3 days) - Complete the adapter trinity
5. **Integration Testing** (1-2 days) - End-to-end dispatcher evaluation

**Target: M2 completion in ~2 weeks**

## Dependencies & Risks

**Technical Dependencies**
- Current FAISS/PyTorch stack remains stable
- Pydantic v2 migration warnings need addressing
- Test infrastructure scales to multi-adapter scenarios

**Research Risks**
- Cost model accuracy depends on real-world usage patterns
- Dispatcher policy effectiveness needs empirical validation
- Performance overhead of routing logic at scale

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Implement comprehensive benchmarking early
- Build configurable cost models for different scenarios
- Design dispatcher with circuit breakers and fallbacks
